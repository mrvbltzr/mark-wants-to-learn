## Public vs. Private Repo

| Feature       | Public Repository                                 | Private Repository                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Visibility    | Everyone can see it                               | Only authorized users can see it                     |
| Access        | Anyone can view, fork, and potentially contribute | Access is granted by the owner                       |
| Collaboration | Open to contributions from anyone                 | Controlled collaboration with specific users         |
| Use Cases     | Open-source projects, sharing code, learning      | Sensitive code, confidential projects, personal work |

Note: We can add collaborator on our GitHub private repos. This allows other users to have varying levels of access and contribute to your private projects.

## README

A README file on GitHub (and other code hosting platforms) is like the welcome sign and instruction manual for your project. It's the first thing people see when they visit your repository, and it's crucial for communicating what your project does, how to use it, and how to contribute.

Think of it as the essential guide that helps people understand and interact with your code.

## Markdown

GitHub primarily uses **Markdown** for README files. While other formats might be displayed, Markdown is the most common, widely supported, and recommended. GitHub renders Markdown beautifully, making it ideal for creating readable and informative READMEs. You'll often see the filename as `README.md` to indicate it's a Markdown file.

## Gist

**GitHub Gist** are a simple way to share code snippets and useful fragments with others. Gist are much easier to create, but offer far fewer features than a typical GitHub repository.

## Pages

**GitHub Pages** are public webpages that are hosted and published via GitHub. They allow you to create a website simply by pushing your code to GitHub.

Pages is a hosting service for static webpages, so it does not support server-side code like Python, PHP, or Node. Just HTML/CSS/JS!
