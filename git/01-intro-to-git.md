## What is Git?

**Git** is the world's most popular **version control system (VCS)**.

## What is a version control?

- **Version control** is a software that tracks and manage changes to file over time.

- **Version control system** generally allow users to revisit earlier version of the file, compare changes between versions, undo changes and a whole lot more.

## Git is just one of many VCS!

- Git is just one of the many version control systems available today. Other well-known ones include **Subversion, CVS and Mercurial.**

- They all have similar goals, but vary significantly in how they achieve those goals.

Imagine Git like a video game where you add checkpoints to a level. If you encounter an issue or make a mistake, you can easily revert back to the last checkpoint without losing all your progress.

## History of Git

**Linus Torvalds** is a legendary software engineer. He is the creator and main developer behind Linux and Git!

In 2005, while working on Linux, he became frustrated with the available version control systems. The existing tools were slow, closed-source, and usually paid.

Torvalds wanted a version control system that was super fast AND free, unlike the existing tools.
On April 3rd 2005 he got to work on his own VCS, which would become Git. In a matter of days he had most basic functionality done.

The first official Git release came a couple months later. 15 years later in 2020, over 90% of developers worldwide use Git on a daily basis!

Torvalds referred to Git as "the stupid content tracker" while he was working on it. Eventually he settled on the name Git.

The official Git source code explains a couple different meanings for the name, depending on your mood:

- a random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not actually used by any common UNIX command.

- stupid, contemptible and despicable. simple.

- "global information tracker": you're in a good mood, and it actually works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.

- "g#ddamn idiotic truckload of sh\*t": when it breaks.
