## Overview

**How Scrum Works:**

 - **Sprint Planning:** The team plans the upcoming sprint by selecting items from the product backlog and defining how they will achieve them.

- **Sprint Backlog:** The team works on the sprint backlog and holds daily stand-up meetings to track progress and address any issues.

- **Sprint Review:** At the end of the sprint, the team demonstrates the completed work and gathers feedback from stakeholders.

- **Sprint Retrospective:** The team reflects on the sprint and identifies areas for improvement in the next sprint.

The **"3-5-3"** in Scrum refers to the core components of the framework:

- 3 roles
- 5 events
- 3 artifacts

## Roles

### Product Owner

- Represents stakeholders and defines the product vision and backlog.

- The product owner is the expert on the product. He/she knows how the product operates, the direction it's stakeholders want it to go, and has a roadmap for getting there. Constant communications at all levels is important for this job.

### SCRUM Master

- Facilitates and guides the team, removes impediments.

- The Scrum Master is there to keep the team going and as productive as possible. They are there to be the multiplier. If you have a team which can produce 100 units of work. The Scrum Master is there to try to make that x2 or 200 units.

## Events

**Scrum events** are the formal opportunities for Scrum teams to inspect and adapt their work. There are five Scrum events:

- **Sprint:** Time-boxed period (usually 1-4 weeks) for delivering an Increment.

- **Sprint Planning:** Plan the Sprint Goal and select work from the Product Backlog.

    - **Scrum Master**

        - Facilitates the meeting

        - Ensures the location is secured and ready

        - Make sure technology is ready for meeting

        - Keeps the meeting moving to fit in the timebox

        - Make sure there is complete alignment with the sprint goal

    - **Product Owner**

        - Comes with a prepared, ready, product backlog

        - Clarify details about any of the backlog items

        - Must be ready to describe the acceptance criteria of something

    - **Development Team**

        - Helps collaborate which tasks will work towards reaching sprint goal as well as are accomplishable

        - Need to be in attendance so you know you expectations for the sprint

- **Daily Scrum:** 15-minute meeting for the Development Team to synchronize and plan for the day.

    - **Scrum Master**

        - Keeps meeting going and in timebox

        - Takes notes of blockers and schedules times to remove blockers

    - **Development Team**

        - Goes over the 3 questions for each person:

            - What did we do yesterday?

            - What are we doing today?

            - What is in our way?

- **Sprint Review:** Inspect the Increment and adjust the Product Backlog if needed.

    - Review Sprint results

    - Discuss and demonstrate work

    - Update status of the project

    - Collaborate on the Plan Ahead

- **Sprint Retrospective:** Reflect on the Sprint and identify improvements.

## Artifacts

**Scrum artifacts** are the tangible representations of the work that a Scrum team is doing. They are used to track progress, communicate information, and make decisions. The three Scrum artifacts are:

### Product Backlog

- The Product Backlog is a prioritized list of all the features and functionality that the team plans to build into the product.

### Sprint Backlog

- The Sprint Backlog is a list of the specific tasks that the team will complete during the current Sprint.

### Increment

- The Increment is the sum of all the work that the team has completed up to the end of the current Sprint.

## Values

### Focus

- Scrum teams are focused on delivering the highest possible value to the customer.

### Respect

- Scrum teams respect each other and the work that they do.

### Commitment

- Scrum teams are committed to delivering a valuable, usable, and potentially releasable product increment at the end of each Sprint.

### Courage

- Scrum teams have the courage to make difficult decisions and to do what is right for the project.

### Openness

- Scrum teams are open to feedback and are willing to change their plans as needed.

## Pillars

### Transparency

- All aspects of the work are visible to everyone involved.

### Inspection

- Regularly check progress and identify issues.

### Adaptation

- Adjust the plan based on what is learned.
