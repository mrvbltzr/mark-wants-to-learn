## Overview

**How Scrum Works:**

 - **Sprint Planning:** The team plans the upcoming sprint by selecting items from the product backlog and defining how they will achieve them.

- **Sprint Backlog:** The team works on the sprint backlog and holds daily stand-up meetings to track progress and address any issues.

- **Sprint Review:** At the end of the sprint, the team demonstrates the completed work and gathers feedback from stakeholders.

- **Sprint Retrospective:** The team reflects on the sprint and identifies areas for improvement in the next sprint.

The **"3-5-3"** in Scrum refers to the core components of the framework:

- 3 roles
- 5 events
- 3 artifacts

## Roles

### Product Owner

- Represents stakeholders and defines the product vision and backlog.

- The product owner is the expert on the product. He/she knows how the product operates, the direction it's stakeholders want it to go, and has a roadmap for getting there. Constant communications at all levels is important for this job.

- **Responsibilities:**

	- Maintains open healthy product backlog
	- Answers product-related questions
	- Communicates with stakeholders and dev teams
	- Manages budget and release dates
	- Ensures the value of the team
	- Respects commitments

### SCRUM Master

- Facilitates and guides the team, removes impediments.

- The Scrum Master is there to keep the team going and as productive as possible. They are there to be the multiplier. If you have a team which can produce 100 units of work. The Scrum Master is there to try to make that x2 or 200 units. They will do everything in their power to remove blocks, increase morale, and make sure everyone is upholding the tenets of SCRUM to keep things productive.

- **Responsibilities:**

	- Facilitating daily stand-up
	- Removes blocks for team
	- Keep the team happy with high morale
	- Ensure all SCRUM values are being upheld
	- Sets up all SCRUM meetings
	- Encourage collaboration between everyone
	- The mediator, coach, mentor and guide

### Development Team

- Self-organizing team responsible for developing the product.

- The development team is there to create the product. They have the skills and expertise to make whatever needs to happen happen. These members should be as cross-functional as possible. This means everyone ideally should be able to accomplish every task. In programming this means full-stack engineers are best for this role.

- **Responsibilities:**

	- Collaborate with product owner to create and refine user stories.
	- Writing code, and tests to fit expectations
	- Conducting research, design and prototyping
	- Helping make decisions based on architectures, design, etc.
	- Helping develop and maintain current iterations

## Events

**Scrum events** are the formal opportunities for Scrum teams to inspect and adapt their work. There are five Scrum events:

- **Sprint:** Time-boxed period (usually 1-4 weeks) for delivering an Increment.

- **Sprint Planning:** Plan the Sprint Goal and select work from the Product Backlog.

	- **Scrum Master**

		- Facilitates the meeting
		- Ensures the location is secured and ready
		- Make sure technology is ready for meeting
		- Keeps the meeting moving to fit in the timebox
		- Make sure there is complete alignment with the sprint goal

	- **Product Owner**

		- Comes with a prepared, ready, product backlog
		- Clarify details about any of the backlog items
		- Must be ready to describe the acceptance criteria of something

	- **Development Team**

		- Helps collaborate which tasks will work towards reaching sprint goal as well as are accomplishable
		- Need to be in attendance so you know you expectations for the sprint

- **Daily Scrum:** 15-minute meeting for the Development Team to synchronize and plan for the day.

	- **Scrum Master**

		- Keeps meeting going and in timebox
		- Takes notes of blockers and schedules times to remove blockers

	- **Development Team**

		- Goes over the 3 questions for each person:

			- What did we do yesterday?
			- What are we doing today?
			- What is in our way?

- **Sprint Review:** Inspect the Increment and adjust the Product Backlog if needed.

	- Review Sprint results
	- Discuss and demonstrate work
	- Update status of the project
	- Collaborate on the Plan Ahead

- **Sprint Retrospective:** Reflect on the Sprint and identify improvements.

## Artifacts

**Scrum artifacts** are the tangible representations of the work that a Scrum team is doing. They are used to track progress, communicate information, and make decisions. The three Scrum artifacts are:

### Product Backlog

- The Product Backlog is a prioritized list of all the features and functionality that the team plans to build into the product.

### Sprint Backlog

- The Sprint Backlog is a list of the specific tasks that the team will complete during the current Sprint.

### Increment

- The Increment is the sum of all the work that the team has completed up to the end of the current Sprint.

## Values

### Focus

- Scrum teams are focused on delivering the highest possible value to the customer.

### Respect

- Scrum teams respect each other and the work that they do.

### Commitment

- Scrum teams are committed to delivering a valuable, usable, and potentially releasable product increment at the end of each Sprint.

### Courage

- Scrum teams have the courage to make difficult decisions and to do what is right for the project.

### Openness

- Scrum teams are open to feedback and are willing to change their plans as needed.

## Pillars

### Transparency

- All aspects of the work are visible to everyone involved.

### Inspection

- Regularly check progress and identify issues.

### Adaptation

- Adjust the plan based on what is learned.
