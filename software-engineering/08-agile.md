## Overview

Waterfall method has issues:

- During verification, a lot of unexpected issues arise.

- Software systems are complex and can't be 100% predicted.

- By the end, some software didn't meet the original or modified requirements.

- Markets move over time. The product could be outdated by the time we finish.

A group of engineers got together and decided a change was needed. Together they came up with the **"Agile Manifesto"**. A set of ideas to develop better, quicker and more agile software.

## Agile Manifesto

- **Individuals and interactions** over process and tools.

	- Focus on teamwork and communication.

- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation.

	- Deliver value quickly, not just paperwork.

- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.

	- Adapt to changing needs.

- **Responding to change** over following a plan.

	- Be prepared to adjust to unexpected challenges.

In essence, Agile prioritizes **people, collaboration, and delivering value** over strict adherence to pre-defined plans and processes.

## Scrum

**Scrum** is an Agile framework for managing software development projects.

- **Key Concepts:**

    - **Sprints:** Short, time-boxed iterations (usually 1-4 weeks) where a specific set of features are developed and released.

	- **Daily Scrum:** A short daily meeting for the team to synchronize and plan for the day.

- **Roles:**

    - **Product Owner:** Defines what needs to be built and prioritizes features.

	- **Scrum Master:** Facilitates the Scrum process, removes roadblocks, and ensures the team follows Scrum principles.

	- **Development Team:** Self-organizing team responsible for delivering the Sprint Goal.

- **Process:**

    1. **Planning:** Determine the Sprint Goal and plan the work to be done.

	1. **Daily Scrum:** Brief daily meeting to discuss progress, roadblocks, and plan for the day ahead.

	2. **Sprint Review:** At the end of the Sprint, demonstrate the completed work to stakeholders and gather feedback.

	3. **Sprint Retrospective:** The team reflects on the Sprint, identifies areas for improvement, and adjusts their process accordingly.

**In essence:** Scrum focuses on iterative development, collaboration, and continuous improvement to deliver value quickly and effectively.

## Kanban

Kanban is a visual system for managing work.

- **Think of it like a board with columns:**

| <center>Backlog</center> | <center>Analyze</center> | <center>Develop</center> | <center>Test</center> | <center>Release</center> |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| -                        | -                        | -                        | -                     | -                        |

- **Work items (tasks) are represented as cards:** These cards move across the board as work progresses.

**Key Principles:**

- **Visualize workflow:** See the progress of work clearly.

- **Limit Work In Progress (WIP):** Don't start too many tasks at once.

- **Manage flow:** Identify and remove bottlenecks.

- **Continuous improvement:** Regularly review and adjust the process.

**In essence:** Kanban helps teams work more efficiently by visualizing their workflow, limiting multitasking, and identifying areas for improvement.

### Kanban Principles

- Start with what do you know.

- Agree to pursue incremental evolutionary change.

- Respect the current process, roles, responsibility and titles.

- Encourage acts of leadership at all levels.

### Kanban Properties

- Visualize workflow

- Limit work in progress

- Manage the flow

- Make process policies explicit

- Improve collaboratively

## Lean Startup

The Lean Startup is a methodology for developing businesses and products that emphasizes:

- **Rapid experimentation:** Testing ideas quickly and cheaply to learn what works and what doesn't.

- **Customer feedback:** Prioritizing customer input and adapting to their needs.

- **Iterative development:** Building and refining products in short cycles, based on feedback.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Minimum Viable Product (MVP):** A basic version of a product with just enough features to attract early adopters and gather valuable feedback.

- **Build-Measure-Learn:** A continuous cycle of building prototypes, measuring customer reactions, and learning from the results to improve the product.

**In essence:** The Lean Startup approach helps businesses avoid wasting time and resources on products that customers don't want by focusing on rapid experimentation, customer feedback, and iterative development.
